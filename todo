FEEDBACK

NEW-PROJECT: Remove starting "Phase" trait

TRAIT-EDITOR: When renaming a trait, we should reserialize all gridlings (I think this will work for free?)

API: TweenableScale doesn't do anything if an object has no renderer
API: be able to index layers by name as well as number (both in Gridling Editor and in Code)
